# A python script for Metashape Pro

This script aims to activate/deactivate automatically the Node-Locked License when opening/exiting the program.  
Useful if you want to transfer the license key from one computer to another one.

* __Prerequisites__

  - __You must open Metashape with admin rights.__  
    An easy way is to make a shortcut of the "Metashape.exe" file, then right click on it, open "Properties" dialog > "Shortcut" tab >         "Advanced" tab> check "execute as administrator".
    
  - __Edit the script__  
    Overwrite the "AutoLicenseKey.py" file in a text editor,just replacing the variable "key = 'XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX'" with           your license Key.
